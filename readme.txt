== Description ==

This plugin adds a previous and next post links on a single post in a conventional way. This plugin creates a new Genesis settings page (Genesis Post Navigation) that allows you to Customize the post navigation colors.
Requires the Genesis framework. 

Animations: On mouseover the previous and next links can travel from north pole to south pole :) 
But, I put just 20px.

*We really thank Andrew Norcross.* We get color selection options from Andrew Norcross's plugin Genesis design pallete.
