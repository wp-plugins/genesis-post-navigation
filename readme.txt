This plugin adds post navigation and an additional option to navigate posts within category.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a previous and next post links on a single post in a conventional way. This plugin creates a new Genesis settings page (Genesis Post Navigation) that allows you to Customize the post navigation colors and to navigate posts within category.

Requires the Genesis framework. 

Animations: On mouseover the previous and next links can travel from north pole to south pole :) 
But, I put just 20px.
